Program Purpose: The purpose of this program is to convert a percentage to a letter grade, or to return the number of days in a given month based on user input. 
- A CSV file containing possible user input for months with the corresponding days should make the program able to handle more robust exceptions handling. 

Inputs:
- User enter the grade percentage
- User enter the desired month
  
Expected Output:
- Should return letter grade per percent entered
- Should return correct number of days in given month
  
Types of execution:

- Repeated execution: For and while loops to repeat parts of the program if desired.
- Sequential execution: User-defined functions are to execute from top to bottom.
- Conditional execution: If else and while loops to determine if the program re-executes.
- Reusable: User-defined functions may be reused inside or outside of the program.

Possible Improvements:
- Putting grade calculations inside a user defined funtion for better utility
- Expand CSV to include years other than 2023
